# create your drupal and postgres config here, based off the last assignment
# Assignment: Writing a Compose File

#> Goal: Create a compose config for a local Drupal CMS website

#- This empty directory is where you should create a docker-compose.yml 
#- Use the `drupal` image along with the `postgres` image
#- Set the version to 2
#- Use `ports` to expose Drupal on 8080
#- Be sure to setup POSTGRES_PASSWORD on postgres image
#- Walk though Drupal config in browser at http://localhost:8080
#- Tip: Drupal assumes DB is localhost, but it will actually be on the compose service name you give it
#- Use Docker Hub documentation to figure out the right environment and volume settings
#- Extra Credit: Use volumes to store Drupal unique data

## Compose File
#- We're going to build a custom image in this compose file for drupal service. 
#Use Compose file from previous assignment for Drupal to start with, and we'll add to it, as well as change image name.
#- Rename image to `custom-drupal` as we want to make a new image based on the official `drupal:8.2`.
#- We want to build the default Dockerfile in this directory by adding `build: .` to the `drupal` service. 
#When we add a build + image value to a compose service, it knows to use the image name to write to in our image cache, 
#rather then pull from Docker Hub.
#- For the `postgres:9.6` service, you need the same password as in previous assignment, 
#but also add a volume for `drupal-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data` so the database will persist across Compose restarts.
